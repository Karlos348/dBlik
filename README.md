# dBlik
Distributed [BLIK](https://www.blik.com/)-like app using the Solana blockchain infrastructure.

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Status-WIP-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/Karlos348/dBlik)

## Motivations
The main goal is to learn about smart contracts and work in other languages than my native C#. The Solana blockchain was chosen rather accidentally, although the most important criteria are low transaction fees and popularity. I enjoy challenges, so I chose a topic I was not sure if it was possible to accomplish.
