[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Status-WIP-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/Karlos348/dBlik)
[![Vercel Deploy](https://deploy-badge.vercel.app/vercel/dblik)](https://dblik.vercel.app/)


## Motivations
The main goal is to learn about smart contracts and work in other languages than my native C#. The Solana blockchain was chosen rather accidentally, although the most important criteria were low transaction fees and popularity. I enjoy challenges, so I've chosen a topic I wasn't sure if it was even possible to accomplish.

## Demo
Web application is available with a dedicated sample store:
- [dBlik: https://dblik.vercel.app/](https://dblik.vercel.app/)
- [store: https://dblik-store.vercel.app/](https://dblik-store.vercel.app/)

It works on the [Devnet cluster](https://explorer.solana.com/address/EE4v8mDaBcnXjYakNPUExR1DGZXS4ba4vyBSrqXXRRF3?cluster=devnet) and requires installing a wallet, such as [Solflare](https://solflare.com/) (preferred) or [Phantom](https://phantom.app/). After creating an account in Devnet network, you can get funds using the [Faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/).

## Research and conclusions
### Generating random code

As it is known, the application relies on generating random codes, which is not feasible within the domain of blockchain. Additionally, all data on the blockchain is public. While I discovered solution like [Switchboard Randomness](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/docs/switchboard/switchboard-randomness), which allows for providing VRF (Verifiable Random Function), it's too expensive for generating a one-time code.

Therefore, I've decided to generate the code off-chain.

### Thousands of transactions at the same time

I was wondering how to store temporary (or not) transaction data. I tried using [Zero Copy Account](https://solana.com/docs/core/accounts#creating), which allows for storing a larger (max 10 MiB vs 10 KiB), but still limited, amount of data. However, I didn't have a solution for handling entry deletions.

I came up with the idea of creating a new Storage Account for each transaction, with a custom address generated, using a random code and timestamp as the seed. In consequence, I don't need to store any references in any central location.

### Generating address from the seed

The built-in function `anchor.web3.SystemProgram.createAccountWithSeed()` [caused the seed to be visible](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/4a2Ra4p59sJeZ4c877xd6hfieqRxSr52begUJKXYDkq9ARPYMotRhwbzD5k8DoD3Ce17qZ6GbudQYUm7vfBK411w?cluster=devnet). 

So, I've decided to use the standard method `anchor.web3.SystemProgram.createAccount()`, in which I can declare separately generated keys and sign the transaction.

## Vulnerabilities

The attacker, by subscribing to changes in the program, can easly obtain the account address with transaction data. They can send a payment request without knowing the code.

One solution that comes to mind first, besides comparing the transaction amount, is attaching additional custom information from the store, such as the name and internal transaction ID. However, this still requires caution from the user.

Another option is to charge the store a refundable fee for hooking up to the transaction, which will be refunded regardless of the success of the transaction.

## Setup

Download the project using Git
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Karlos348/dBlik.git
```

### dBlik - client

#### Requirements:
Node.js >= 20.x

#### Stages to run
Go to the project directory
```
cd ./app/dblik
```
Create `.env.local` file by copying the default values from `.env.prod`
```
cp .env.prod .env.local
```
Intall the dependecies
```
npm install
```
Run application
```
npm run dev
```
